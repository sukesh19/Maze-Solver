# Maze-Solver
This project implements a maze solver in C++ using two fundamental graph traversal algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). Given a maze represented as a grid, the program finds a path from the start position to the goal if one exists, marking the path in the maze.
